                                roof regularly. Also, keep the roof clean and free of oils and debris to give you
                                maximum years of protection and performance. Touch up any damaged areas caused by
                                branches or limbs immediately to prevent additional substrate deterioration.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0 mt-20">CAUTION: RvRoofmagic may be slippery when wet. Exercise caution when
                                walking on the roof system. Note: This is important, particularly when walking on
                                light-colored surfaces, as any ice or frost may not be directly visible on the dark

                                    <p class="text-white">Ensure Proper Drainage: By periodic inspections of the roof
                                        surface and by cleaning any leaves, twigs and other debris that may accumulate
                                        over time, you will be extending years to your roof system. Ponding water on the
                                        surface of the system will increase the probability of moisture entering the
                                        structure BUT only as a result of a puncture or cut caused by physical damage.
                                        RvRoofmagic will withstand ponding water 365 days a year.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white">Limit foot traffic: RvRoofmagic will certainly take light
                                        traffic, but we do not recommend heavy foot traffic. Any unprotected areas of
                                        the surface are more susceptible to damage from constant foot traffic.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white">Avoid harming and/or breaking down RvRoofmagic by exposing the
                                        finished coating to harsh chemicals, particularly those containing petroleum
                                        products. Wash roof with Roof Protect available on our order form. Many RV
                                        cleaners sold in RV retail stores can also be used. Refrain from using solvents
                                        and use caution when using grease for lubricating your AC or vent hinges.
                                        Prolonged exposure to these materials will cause swelling and possible
                                        degradation of the system if spills are not removed.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white">Avoid puncturing the system. Be sure to protect the roof from
                                        puncture and any abrasion. In the event of damage. Clean roof thoroughly to
                                        remove any dirt and recoat effected area.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white">When snow is on the surface, use only a plastic shovel to
                                        avoid cutting into the membrane. Most snow removal damage occurs when shoveling
                                        around your AC and vents.</p>

                                        suggested for your RV roof. This is not only to inspect the roof coating, but
                                        the entire roof, noting any maintenance issues related to drainage roof vents
                                        and other penetrations; likely areas for future roof issues.</p>

                                        Parapets and edgings should also be examined for evidence of cracking,
                                        deterioration and moisture infiltration. In addition to the above inspection,
                                        you should also inspect the roof in the following situations.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white">Pressure Washing: Use a white (40 degree) wide nozzle tip with
                                        a maximum 2000 psi pressure washer. Start with the tip at 18” off the deck
                                        surface and saturate the area with water. Generally, “softening” the debris will
                                        allow for less chance of damage to the coating. Come back to the area and
                                        gradually lower the tip to the deck until you see the debris coming off but do
                                        not allow the tip to get lower than 6” from the deck. Warranties will not be
                                        covered on premature erosion related to abrasion caused by excessive pressure.
