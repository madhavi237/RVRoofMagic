                                We suggest performing an inspection of your roof. Look for any separations in seams.
                                Also, around your joints, AC’s and vents, check for any loose caulk or areas where
                                caulk may be needed. Our butyl MX caulk has been field tested to be compatible with
                                our RvRoofMagic, so it will not void the warranty. Be sure any silicone caulk
                                currently on the roof is replaced with the butyl MX caulk.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-0 mt-20 text-white">
                                A light power wash, if you have one, is great. Otherwise, use a good bristle brush.
                                The roof must be clean, dry and free of any oil, grease, dirt or loosely adhered
                                coating. Surface should be cleaned with Roof Protect to ensure proper adhesion. We
                                suggest our Roof Protect to thoroughly clean your roof. It was field tested to be
                                compatible with RvRoofMagic and provides a very deep cleaning vs standard cleaners.
                                Roof Protect emulsifies contaminates and provides improved surface preparation by
                                effectively removing oil, grease, mildew, dirt, and other soils from your roofing
                                membrane. It also has a built in mildewcide to kill any living mold spores on your
                                roof prior to application of the RvRoofMagic.

                            <p class="mb-0 mt-20">RvRoofMagic is applied at approximately 50 sq. ft per gallon. The
                                easiest
                                way to accomplish this is to chalk off your roof into 5 X 10 areas. Once you are done
                                filling in one of those areas, you should be finished with a gallon of RvRoofMagic. Be
                                sure
                                your roof is perfectly dry before application. Many customers will tape off their roof
                                with
                                blue painter’s tape to avoid any possible running. RvRoofMagic is ready to use; thinning
                                is
                                not required. Mix for approximately five minutes with an electric drill mixer to allow
                                the
                                solvent to be distributed. Application of the product is with a medium nap roller (3/8
                                inch)
                                (not a foam roller), and chip brush around corners and vertical surfaces.</p>

                                properly, so air does not get in. Average dry time: Dry to touch in 3 – 4 hours. Wait a
                                full
                                24 hours before traveling. Should you choose to apply a second coat, wait 24 hours. Rain
                                should not be in the forecast on the day you apply the product. However, should a very
                                light
                                rain fall within 2-3 hours of application, the roof is already protected. You may see
                                rain
                                dimples on the surface, depending on the strength of the rain. If seams are not properly
                                adhered, it may cause the tape to bubble up or raise as will a rubber roof that has lost
                                adhesion to the wood substrate. Applying the product too thick will cause it to wrinkle.
                                Keep in mind the surface temp must be under 140 during application.</p>

                    <p class="text-theme-black mt-20 mb-0">Depending on your EPDM roof’s age and overall condition, some
                        customers may
                        experience slight bubbling only on EPDM roofs. This is just a temporary aesthetic situation, and
                        the
                        product will self-level as the solvent evaporates to the surface. To avoid any potential
                        bubbling
                        during the drying process, although it is not necessary, you can apply a “flash coat” of the
                        RvRoofMagic (a very light coat)—approximately 1.5 gallons for 200 square feet. The balance you
                        have
                        will be enough for your main coat. The flash coat DOES NOT require purchasing additional
                        RVRoofMagic. Too thick a flash coat may result in temporary bubbling of the material. A minimum
                        3-4
                        hour dry time depending on temperature is suggested before proceeding with main coat. Cooler
                        temps
                        or high humidity may retard your cure times. The flash coat should be completely dry before
                        applying
                        the final coat. After September, we suggest at least 36 hours between flash coat and main coat
                        due
                        to environmental conditions. Cooler ambient air temperatures and active dew points play a factor
                        in
                        the flash coat as they will also increase cure times.</p>
                    <p class="text-theme-black mt-20 mb-0">This product is for outdoor use. If you choose to use it
                        indoors,
                        you will
                        need a Niosh respirator, available at Home Depot or Uline. As the product begins to dry any
                        brush or
                        roller marks will disappear and what is left is a seamless coating. It will be as if someone
